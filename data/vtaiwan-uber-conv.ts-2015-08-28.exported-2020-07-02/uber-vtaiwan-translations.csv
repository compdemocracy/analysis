1437581877757,Wed Jul 22 12:17:57 EDT 2015,77,0,330,198,1,我覺得 UberX 應比照計程車，將登記證、執照、駕駛完整資訊擺設於車內明顯可見之處。,"I think an UberX driver, as a taxi driver, should display the license, the registration certificate, and the complete driver information in a visible place inside the car.",,Olga Cheng,"I think UberX taxi mutatis mutandis, the registration certificate, license, driving complete information furnished in the car visible place."
1437582487279,Wed Jul 22 12:28:07 EDT 2015,78,0,296,199,1,我覺得搭乘他人的自用車，若是無從判斷此人是否通過測驗及健檢，感覺非常沒有保障。,"I feel very insecure, having no way to tell if the driver had passed the health check and the test, when riding on a personal-use vehicle.",,Olga Cheng,"I think the car ride from others, if not judge whether the person through the test and health check, feeling very insecure."
1437584342895,Wed Jul 22 12:59:02 EDT 2015,80,0,270,145,1,我覺得 Uber 「費率加成」的邏輯很不透明，導致有時候 UberBlack 會比 UberX 要便宜的奇怪情況出現。,"I feel the logic behind the ubers’ surge pricing is very opaque, which sometimes resulting in awkward situation where UberBlack is cheaper than UberX.",,Olga Cheng,"I think Uber ""bonus rates"" logic is very opaque, resulting in sometimes UberBlack will be cheaper than UberX strange situation occurs."
1437622394425,Wed Jul 22 23:33:14 EDT 2015,87,852,393,75,1,我覺得雖然加成計費會讓人比較不想搭Uber，加成計費依照供需法則去變化是合理的。,"I feel that although the increase of Uber fare may result in less popularity, the increase is based on the law of supply and demand then it is reasonable. ",,Cassandra L.,"I feel that although the addition billing will make people more do not want to take the Uber, in accordance with the law of supply and demand in addition to the accounting change is reasonable."
1437622910789,Wed Jul 22 23:41:50 EDT 2015,90,0,366,74,1,我覺得Uber透過應用程式客訴時，問題獲得解決的效率比投訴計程車來得高。,"I think that through Uber complaint program, problems solving is more efficient than the taxi program.",,Cassandra L.,"I think when the Uber app customer complaints, problem solved is more efficient than a taxi complaints."
1437630163708,Thu Jul 23 01:42:43 EDT 2015,94,0,294,110,1,我覺得要提前考慮電腦自動駕駛的情況，包括現代大眾系統是否還有興建必要，以及以後計程車司機的就業該怎麼辦。,"I think the computerized/automatic driving situation must be considered ahead of time, including wheather it's necessary to build a modern public system, as well as considering the employment future for the taxi drivers.",,Cassandra L.,"I think we need to consider in advance autopilot computer case, including whether to build a modern public system also necessary, as well as future employment taxi drivers how to do."
1437680088092,Thu Jul 23 15:34:48 EDT 2015,100,0,271,118,1,我覺得「駕駛自己要去的目的地，和搭乘的人相同」才是共乘的精神，繞行等待載客的不能算是共乘。,I think the essence of carpooling is 'to share the same destination with the carpooler'. Going around to wait for passengers can't be considered carpooling.,,Cassandra L.,"I think ""driving his intended destination, and take the same people"" is the carpool spirit, bypass waiting passengers can not be regarded carpool."
1437789638408,Fri Jul 24 22:00:38 EDT 2015,106,1081,349,65,1,我覺得要替UberX找到出口，就該訂定有別於職業小客車和計程車的法規，讓非營業車，只是要共乘或補貼油錢的，兼職性質的自用車，有一個遵守的遊戲規則,"I think in order for UberX to find a way out, it shoud set different rules and regulations from the minibus and taxis. Let non-business operating cars to just carpool or subsidize gas money, a part-time good quality personal car, with the compliance of game rules.",,Cassandra L. ,"I think UberX asked to find the exit, laid in respect unlike occupational minibus and taxi regulations for non-commercial vehicles, carpool or just to subsidize oil money from part-time nature of the car, there is a compliance with rules of the game"
1438145816736,Wed Jul 29 00:56:56 EDT 2015,120,1324,91,161,1,我覺得自用車載客應該登記，每日以上下班兩趟為限，可達共乘效果，並應加買保障乘客的保險,I think the personal-use vehicle should be registered and be limited to twice commute by carpool daily. The liability insurance for the passenger should also be included.,,Olga Cheng,"I think it should be for personal use passenger car registration, more than twice the daily commute is limited up to carpool effect, and should be added to protect the passengers to buy insurance"
1438151947603,Wed Jul 29 02:39:07 EDT 2015,122,1431,181,87,1,個人認為應比照小黃立個規範，想開uber的駕駛都須通過由交通部監理單位所舉辦的行車認證或考試，考過便可核發個人或營業用登記證，一來可保障所有乘客，另一方面可保障所有駕駛的基本權利。,"I think the Uber driver should have passed the driving license test for a professional light passenger vehicle from the Motor Vehicles Office and then applied for a taxi driver’s practice registration certificate, according to taxi driver’s norm, which will ensure all passenger and driver fundamental rights",,Olga Cheng,"Huang Li personally think that should be subjected to a small norm, would like to open uber drivers are required to pass the driving exam or certification by the Ministry of Transportation organized supervision unit, the test is too personal or business can be issued with a registration certificate, the one can protect all the passengers, On the other hand the basic rights of all drivers can be guaranteed."
1438152019898,Wed Jul 29 02:40:19 EDT 2015,123,1406,198,67,1,我覺得UBER問題是否應該立法(或修法)？應取決於UBER服務是否有夠大影響力，目前來看，影響人民日常並不大。若民意機關覺得影響性夠大，我讚成修法或立法。,"I think the problem of Uber could be legislation (or amending the laws)? It should depends on how great of an impact of Uber's services, from the current situation, the impact on people's daily life isn't great. If public opinion agency thinks that the influence is great enough, I agree to amend the laws or legislations. ",,Cassandra L.,"I think the question should be whether UBER legislation (or amending the law)? UBER service should depend on whether there are enough big influence on the present situation, affecting people's daily not great. If elected officials feel the influence of big enough, I am in favor of amending the law or legislation."
1438174079779,Wed Jul 29 08:47:59 EDT 2015,133,1816,227,32,1,將Uber合法，能讓司機與乘客都能受到更好的保障，只希望台灣政府能擬定法規,Making Uber legitimate would give the drivers and passengers a better protection. Only to wish that the Taiwanese government would draw up some regulations. ,,Cassandra L.,"The Uber legitimate, allowing drivers and passengers can receive better protection, can only hope that the Taiwan government proposed rule"
1438195914064,Wed Jul 29 14:51:54 EDT 2015,135,2354,214,34,1,外縣市白牌車坐地起價，時有所聞，若能像über 有公開透明的費率，并且不會亂繞路，會吸引更多乘客搭乘,"The 'white brand car' raises its fare in other counties from time to time, if it can be like Uber to have transparent open rate, plus not taking long route would attract even more customers. ",,Cassandra L.,"White counties outside car license price hike, when heard, like über if there is an open and transparent rates, and will not mess detour, will attract more passengers to take"
1438227744955,Wed Jul 29 23:42:24 EDT 2015,137,2389,191,44,1,我覺得搭計程車是ㄧ件要冒險的事情，因為車輛品質參差不齊，司機的品質也參差不齊。,I feel like taking taxi is a risky thing to do because the quality of vehicles and the character of drivers are inconsistent.,,Cassandra L.,"I think the taxi was ㄧ risky thing to do, because the vehicle quality is uneven, uneven quality drivers."
1438273973339,Thu Jul 30 12:32:53 EDT 2015,140,1084,203,35,1,我覺得既然出了北中高，台灣其他鄉鎮市的計程車幾乎都是白牌車，搭車時總是坐地起價，不如立法全數納入規範。,"I feel that except big cities like Taipei, Taichung , and Kaohsiung, all other places in Taiwan, taxi drivers are almost private owners. They call the fare as they wish, it is better to make new law to include whole drivers fully into the specification.",,Olga Cheng,"I feel that since the high north, other townships in Taiwan almost all white taxi car brand is always a price hike when riding, as legislation fully into the specification."
1438394081007,Fri Jul 31 21:54:41 EDT 2015,141,258,208,25,1,我覺得繳稅是一個企業在台灣經營的義務，Uber或其新創模式再麼優秀，在台灣的所得都應該要盡到合法納稅義務。,,,,"I think it is the obligation of a tax business operations in Taiwan, Uber, or create a new model then it excellent, resulting in Taiwan should try to be legitimate tax liability."
1438923403206,Fri Aug 07 00:56:43 EDT 2015,143,2582,181,34,1,我覺得法律僅須訂定一個能保護乘客、司機其他用路人的最低標準，其他應交由市場機制來決定。,,,,"I think the only shall fix a law to protect the passengers, the driver of the other passers-by with the minimum standards, the other should be left to the market mechanism to decide."
1439122448201,Sun Aug 09 08:14:08 EDT 2015,144,1676,153,51,1,我覺得開放Uber是提升臺灣基礎競爭力重要的一環,I think legalizing Uber as an essential step toward upgrading Taiwan's fundamental competitiveness.,,Tzu-Chi Yen,I think open Uber is to enhance the competitiveness of Taiwan's base important part
1439865544456,Mon Aug 17 22:39:04 EDT 2015,145,864,160,31,1,我覺得既有的資格審查，無法保證計程車司機的服務品質,,,,"I think both of qualification, can not guarantee the quality of service of taxi driver"
1439870879861,Tue Aug 18 00:07:59 EDT 2015,150,2938,158,24,1,應修改讓自用車的乘客保險也能保障乘客的權益或由UBER統一投保,,,,Should be modified so that the passenger car from the insurance can also protect the interests of passengers or the insurance of UBER
1439871112948,Tue Aug 18 00:11:52 EDT 2015,151,2999,122,26,1,我覺得目前管理職業客車的法規對分享經濟很不友善。應該要盡速修法，比較環保,"I think that currently, the regulation for business passenger vehicles is very unfriendly to the sharing economy. A quick amendment is needed, which is eco-friendly. ",,Tzu-Chi Yen,"I think the management of occupational regulations buses share the economic unfriendly. It should be as soon as possible to amend the law, more environmentally friendly"
1439873787702,Tue Aug 18 00:56:27 EDT 2015,153,3104,144,20,1,我贊成uber合法化，讓消費者多一個選擇，讓計程車業者多一份良性競爭的動力，更讓兼職管道多方面開放。,"I am in favor of the legalized Uber operation. This will not only offer consumers an alternative choice, but also motivate the Taxi industry with a healthy competition and open up a multifaceted part-time job market.",,Tzu-Chi Yen,"I agree with uber legalization, allow consumers a choice, let the taxi industry more of a healthy competition of power, leaving many part-time pipeline open."
1439874979313,Tue Aug 18 01:16:19 EDT 2015,154,3120,78,40,1,我覺得UberX在計費上，晚上應該費用能提高，不能以低價只為了乘客，卻讓司機無力持續，造成車輛數減少。,"I think UberX should increase their pricing rate at night, rather than offering discounts to attract users but scare away drivers, which eventually reduces the amount of vehicles around. ",,Tzu-Chi Yen,"I think UberX on billing, night should be able to increase the cost, not only for passengers at a low price, allows the driver unable to continue, resulting in reduced number of vehicles."
1439908456464,Tue Aug 18 10:34:16 EDT 2015,156,923,45,95,1,我覺得UBER跟政府成立的共乘網 都是媒合平臺 都與交通部無關,"The carpool network, be it founded by the Uber itself or the government, is a matching platform, which is irrelavent to the Ministry of Transportation, I think.",,Tzu-Chi Yen,I think the government set up a carpool with UBER network are matchmaking platform has nothing to do with the Ministry of Transportation
1439911456948,Tue Aug 18 11:24:16 EDT 2015,157,2202,106,44,1,我覺得Uber應該把該繳的稅繳給政府，政府無須過多干預，讓Uber與小黃自由競爭；消費者有選擇的權利，如果覺得Uber不安全或沒保障，一樣可以去搭小黃，而這如果是大眾普遍的想法，那Uber自然會被市場機制淘汰，政府何須過多干預呢？,"I think Uber should pay the owed tax to the government, and the government should let Uber and existing taxis compete without extra intervention. The consumers have the right to choose; they can ride on taxis if they feel Uber is unsafe or insecure. If the majority think so, Uber will be fallen into disuse by the natural market mechanism, the government has no need to intervene at all.",,Olga Cheng,"I think that Uber should pay the taxes paid to the government, without too much government intervention, let Uber free competition with small yellow; consumers have the right to choose, if they feel unsafe or Uber no job security, and they can go take a small yellow, and If this is the general public's idea that Uber will naturally be out of the market mechanism, why should the government interfere too much of it?"
1439980502803,Wed Aug 19 06:35:02 EDT 2015,159,1065,67,32,1,不管法律層面前提下，uber的媒合效益比較好，計程車的距離效益比較好,"Regardless of the legal aspects, Uber has a better matching rate, whereas Taxis are cheaper at a shorter traveling distance.",,Tzu-Chi Yen,"Regardless of the legal aspects under the premise, uber matchmaking benefits of better, from the taxi benefit is better"
1439980608601,Wed Aug 19 06:36:48 EDT 2015,160,1065,65,38,1,就管理面，除非uber承認自己是虛擬叫車公司，不然管理是比較弱。,"On management, unless Uber admits itself as a virtual taxi provider, otherwise its management is a downside.",,Tzu-Chi Yen,"On the management side, unless uber admit that he is called a virtual car company, or management is weak."
1439980983364,Wed Aug 19 06:43:03 EDT 2015,161,1065,66,24,1,就安全面，職業駕照跟自用相比，筆試多了地點跟景點，路試多了更窄的S與行車線，交通安全規則都一樣。,"On safety, the drivers license test for business has additionally the ""location"" and ""attraction"" sections in the written test, whereas the road test contains narrower S-shaped lanes, despite that the rules of the road are the same.",,Tzu-Chi Yen,"On the security side, compared with the professional driver's license for personal use, written more than a place with attractions, road test more and more narrow lane S, Jiaotonganquan rules are the same."
1439982086152,Wed Aug 19 07:01:26 EDT 2015,162,1065,39,19,1,就駕駛而言，計程車司機的收入比uber好，uber司機收入是計程車車資六成。,"On driving, the taxi driver's income is better than that of the Uber driver, who earns only 60% than the former.",,Tzu-Chi Yen,"On driving, the taxi drivers 'income is better than uber, uber fare taxi drivers' income is Liu Cheng."
1440242549539,Sat Aug 22 07:22:29 EDT 2015,164,3428,63,52,1,香港取締Uber不只是對司機開罰，也逮捕了公司負責人，台灣取締Uber只會罰罰款罷了，請鐵腕一點好嗎? 隨意車輛人員都能載客，只是犧牲掉了乘客(人民)安全。,"Hong Kong banned Uber via fining the driver and arresting the company principal, while Taiwan only banned the first. The Taiwan government must enforce the law on Uber much harder! Any private driver can take a ride, which is sacrificing the passengers’ (peoples) safety.",,Olga Cheng,"Hong Kong banned Uber not just for the driver to open a penalty, also arrested the head of the company, Taiwan banned Uber penalty fines will only fills your iron hand alright? Random vehicle personnel can carry passengers, but sacrificed passengers (people's) safety."
1440424011091,Mon Aug 24 09:46:51 EDT 2015,165,3526,75,19,1,"我覺得真正共乘的精神, 應該要讓司機能選擇去什麼地區的乘客一起搭乘, 否則共乘只是白牌車營業賺錢的包裝罷了。",,,,"I think the real spirit carpool, you should ask the driver can choose to take the passengers what areas together, carpool or just white brand car business profitable packaging Bale."
1440688064551,Thu Aug 27 11:07:44 EDT 2015,169,3526,75,23,1,"我覺得Uber的評分機制很好, 而且有效的管理, 將低分司機淘汰掉, 所以一般司機如果犯嚴重的錯誤, 將永久禁止合作, 相反的計程車犯了錯依然可以繼續上路, 所以Uber對消費者來說是比較有保障的平台。",,,,"I feel good scoring mechanism Uber, and effective management, will eliminate low-scoring drivers, so generally if the driver committed a serious error, will be permanently prohibit cooperation, on the contrary taxi mistake can still continue on the road, so the consumer Uber who is more secure platform."
1440694221425,Thu Aug 27 12:50:21 EDT 2015,170,3679,33,42,1,以前是車行管司機，現在是車隊管司機。所以品牌車隊大家比較有信心搭乘，因為有在管理。現在車行不太管司機，所以未加入車隊的司機就比較會胡搞瞎搞。uber現在司機少問題不大，等到uber司機多了，大概就像現在很多沒人管的司機一樣了。而且uber只用APP管司機？各位覺得這樣真的好嗎？,"The drivers have been managed mostly by the Association of Taxi Drivers in the past and by the car fleets nowadays. People are confident to ride on the branding fleet’s car due to the better management. The  association don’t manage their drivers well enough, so they are often irresponsible. Uber doesn’t have many drivers so less trouble now. Once there are more Uber drivers, and Uber only manages them via the app, those Uber drivers might act like those irresponsible ones from the association. How do you think it will be?",,Olga Cheng,"Dealers Tube drivers used to be, now is the team Tube drivers. So the brand team we are more confident to take, because there are in management. Dealers now unlikely tube driver, so the driver will not join the team more likely to mess messing around. uber small problem now is not the driver, the driver until the uber much, probably just as many now nobody drivers the same. And uber only APP Tube drivers? You think this is really you?"
1440709992241,Thu Aug 27 17:13:12 EDT 2015,171,3691,49,62,1,我覺得UBER避稅很正常，就如同你在申報所得稅時會選擇最低金額的申報方式一樣正常。,,,,"I think UBER tax avoidance normal, just as you would choose methods of reporting the lowest amount in your income tax as normal."
1440710706161,Thu Aug 27 17:25:06 EDT 2015,172,3691,84,13,1,我覺得UBER與計程車車隊的評分系統最大差別是：UBER的評分系統公開透明且貫徹執行，分數低於4.5的駕駛一定會被停機，也因此確保了車輛品質。相反的，計程車車隊的評分系統完全是黑箱，輸入方式不僅不利於乘客使用，評分系統也無鑑別度可言。即使按完後，乘客也無法得知車隊是否有收到評分。,,,,"I think the biggest difference UBER taxi fleet and scoring system are: UBER scoring system is transparent and open implementation, scores below 4.5 driver will be shut down, and thus ensure the quality of the vehicle. Instead, the taxi fleet scoring system is completely black box, input mode is not conducive to passengers, nor the identification of the scoring system at all. Even after the press, the passengers can not know whether the team had received scores."
1440864144461,Sat Aug 29 12:02:24 EDT 2015,173,3805,51,35,1,不應該限制計程車的車輛顏色外觀式樣內裝等等，再好的車噴成黃色很難看，圖利特定廠商而且造成購車成本增加，消費者失去新鮮感,"The taxi car’s appearance, color, interior, and model should not be limited. No matter how cool the car is, it will become very ugly once painted in yellow, which is in favor of certain manufacturers, leading the car purchase cost to increase, and the consumers to lose the freshness feeling.",,Olga Cheng,"Should not limit the color of the taxi vehicle interior styling and so on, no matter how good the car painted in yellow hard to see, Tu Lite set manufacturers and cause an increase in purchase costs, consumers lose freshness"
1440889629666,Sat Aug 29 19:07:09 EDT 2015,174,3832,43,33,1,我覺得Uber既然標榜共乘那就應該以共乘為主，而不是一堆都是職業司機，搞得跟小黃做一樣的生意卻不受職業駕駛法規管制。,"Since Uber is a carpool app, the driver and the rider should have the same direction to go. However, most Uber drivers are professionals, doing taxi driver’s jobs but not subject to the same professional driving regulation.",,Olga Cheng,"I think Uber since flaunt it should carpool to carpool, not for a bunch are professional drivers, and made do with small yellow business is not subject to the same regulatory controls driving career."

1447168804607,Tue Nov 10 10:20:04 EST 2015,179,4084,1,0,0,我認為Uberx的使用出於絕對的自願，應於法規上推向契約履行的保護，而不是限制契約自由，且已有法定記程車供有疑慮者選擇。,,,,"I think Uberx use for absolutely voluntary, contractual protection should be pushed to perform in the regulations, and not to limit freedom of contract, and existing legal taxis in mind for those who have doubts about choice."
1448097795349,Sat Nov 21 04:23:15 EST 2015,180,4094,1,0,0,計程車駕駛至少有經過警察機關核可之職業證明，但Uber並無相同機制，擔心安全,,,,"Taxi drivers have at least proved that after the approval by the professional police, but no Uber same mechanism, worried about security"

1451878620176,Sun Jan 03 22:37:00 EST 2016,183,4120,1,0,0,探討法律、稅務、安全等問題時，應先理解供需，為什麼民眾會選擇Uber？簡單說就是機會成本的選擇，搭乘Uber比搭乘計程車得到的更多。制定新的控管規定外，還須提升本土產業的競爭力，對任何產業來說都是一樣，如果搭計程車比較好，這問題都不是問題了。與時代和科技一起進步才是解決問題的根本,,,,"When explore the legal, tax, security and other issues, supply and demand should first understand why people would choose Uber? It simply is the opportunity cost of choices, take more than that to get Uber taxi. Controls the development of new regulations, we must also enhance the competitiveness of local industries, is the same for any industry, if a taxi is better, the problem is not a problem. Progress is to solve the problem together with the times and technology are fundamental"

1472118003915,Thu Aug 25 05:40:03 EDT 2016,185,4316,1,0,0,我覺得Uber與計程車提供的是不同的服務，前者，預約點對點，後者，隨招隨搭，不用混為一談。,,,,"I think the Uber taxi service provided is different, the former, booking point, the latter, with the move to take over, do not be confused."
1472276740721,Sat Aug 27 01:45:40 EDT 2016,186,4363,1,0,0,UBER是一個鼓勵租車買車經營的平台，並非純粹的共享平台，無論其包裝為何，提供方案讓參與者租車買車利於期經營就並非共享經濟，而是用強大資本基礎與特許產業競爭，創新是需要被支持，而假創新之名的產業，政府也許應制定更高稅則的標準，維持產業價格基礎避免價格競爭，最後的結果才叫市場機制,,,,"UBER rental car is a platform to encourage business, not a purely sharing platform, regardless of what the package offers a car rental program participants in favor of economic operators will not share, but with a strong capital base and franchise industry competition, innovation need to be supported, and industry innovation fake name, maybe the government should set standards higher tariff to maintain the industrial base prices to avoid price competition, the final result is called market mechanisms"

1472549771795,Tue Aug 30 05:36:11 EDT 2016,188,4412,1,0,0,我覺得計程車是大眾運輸的一種交通工具之一，基於對於乘客以及駕駛者雙方安全的保障，本就應該要有一個有政府來管理並保障雙方的機制。,,,,"I think the taxi is one of one kind Jiaotonggongju public transport, based on both the driver and passenger for security guarantees, the government should have a mechanism to manage and protect both parties."
1472549925203,Tue Aug 30 05:38:45 EDT 2016,189,4412,1,0,0,我覺得每個人的確有選擇以及從事工作的自由，利用共享經濟的機制為自己賺取收入是一件合理的事情。,,,,I think everyone does have a choice and working of the free use of mechanisms for sharing economic income is a reasonable thing for yourself.
1472550042126,Tue Aug 30 05:40:42 EDT 2016,190,4412,1,0,0,我覺得計程車和Uber的差異之一，就是如何確保適當的人來開車，而這攸關乘客的安全。,,,,"I think one of the differences taxis and Uber is how to ensure the right people to drive, and it concerns the safety of passengers."
1472550225914,Tue Aug 30 05:43:45 EDT 2016,191,4412,1,0,0,我覺得不能用計程車司機的素質不佳來當作推廣Uber的理由，但是計程車的管理方式應該要重新的思考,,,,"I do not think the quality of taxi drivers with poor reason as to promote Uber, a taxi but the management should be re-thinking"
1472550484869,Tue Aug 30 05:48:04 EDT 2016,192,4412,1,0,0,我覺得針對此案的相關法律調整，必須要快點進行，不能因為現在Uber的司機不多而認為影響人民日常不大，畢竟這共享經濟的議題，已經是一個在發展的趨勢,,,,"I think the case for the relevant legal regulation, must be carried out quickly, not because not many Uber driver and now thought to affect people's daily little, after all, share issues this economy is already in a trend"
1472551357201,Tue Aug 30 06:02:37 EDT 2016,193,4412,1,0,0,我覺得要表達意見的人，應該要有多次搭乘Uber的經驗，所表達的意見才會有參考的價值。,,,,"I think people want to express their views, should have multiple Uber ride experience, the views expressed will have reference value."
1472552518501,Tue Aug 30 06:21:58 EDT 2016,194,4413,1,0,0,Uber的出現 因服務內容明確、平台簡潔、交易程序精簡、路線糾紛減少，並有評價機制穩定服務雙方之水平 的確在服務體現有較好的比例 但並不代表沒有優質的計程車服務 依循相同法規 可確保涉及群體的權利與義務 但並不應強行勒令符合現行法規 而是檢討時下及未來趨勢應有的規範內容,,,,"Uber appear indeed better reflect the proportion of the service because services clear, concise platform, streamlining trade procedures, reduce disputes route, and there are two sides of the evaluation mechanism and stable service level but does not mean no quality of taxi service can follow the same regulations ensure that the rights and obligations involved in groups but should not be forced to comply with current regulations but ordered to review the normative content of today's and future trends due"
1473020958833,Sun Sep 04 16:29:18 EDT 2016,195,4441,1,0,0,我覺得作為公共運輸分uber應該招募一定比例的車子在偏鄉作業。,,,,I think as the public transport sub uber should recruit a certain percentage of the car in partial rural jobs.
1485724709112,Sun Jan 29 16:18:29 EST 2017,196,4550,1,0,0,我覺得Uber對於收入不高或是在多數就業市場上會被歧視的人，可成為其「重要」的收入來源。,,,,"I think Uber for low income or be discriminated against in the job market most people, can be a source of income for their ""important"" is."

1437103325709,Thu Jul 16 23:22:05 EDT 2015,25,74,1,0,-1,"UBER違法遭營運，交通部也已勒令停業，為什麼交通部毫無作為，讓UBER繼續營運?政府不依法行政積極取締非法，真是無能啊!
",,,,"UBER was illegal operations, Ministry of Transportation has also been ordered to close down, as there is no why the Ministry of Transportation, let UBER continue to operate? Government does not actively against illegal administrative law, really incompetent ah!
"
1437104426943,Thu Jul 16 23:40:26 EDT 2015,26,96,1,0,-1,我覺得uber在國內己受違法停業處分，怎可仍在大街小巷橫行無阻，違法的營業行為容許它存在，就表示政府的無能，國家機關威信斷殤，不作為讓國人憂心；豈有為不法行為者要國人表示意見。,,,,"I think the uber in the country has been subject to illegal closure of punishment, how can you still in the streets unimpeded rampage, illegal business behavior allows it to exist, it means that the incompetence of the government, state organs prestige broken War, so that people are not as worried about; anything too lawless to people who have an opinion."
1437104528656,Thu Jul 16 23:42:08 EDT 2015,27,103,1,0,-1,我覺得uber使用app載客，是違法因為這因該是屬於計程車的業務，再來本身uber在臺灣登記是資訊業，並不是計程車得運輸業，再來計程車司機資格考試越來越難考，反之uber並不需要這些考核只需要職業駕照，uber鼓勵自用車加入載客安全性發生事情了，難道也是政府會出來負責嗎，所以既然uber是違法請政府認真該處理就該註銷公司登記,,,,"I think the uber use app passengers, is illegal because it is part of the business because of the taxi, again uber itself is registered in Taiwan information industry, transportation was not a taxi, the taxi driver qualification examinations come more and more difficult to test, Conversely uber does not need to assess these needs only professional driver's license, uber encouraged to join car passenger safety since things happen, do not they also responsible for the government will come out of it, since it is illegal to ask uber government to seriously deal with the company in respect of cancellation of registration"
1437105865086,Fri Jul 17 00:04:25 EDT 2015,33,106,1,0,-1,我認為不該有這種車隊 收費不合理  車隊管理很差 然後沒受過專業駕駛訓練,,,,I think this team should not have unreasonable charges fleet management is poor and not received professional driver training
1437126439284,Fri Jul 17 05:47:19 EDT 2015,36,158,1,0,-1,那有在台灣購我們的錢，卻不用繳稅，政府立場在那裡？是否也鼓勵人民如此做？非法就抓，那才是正確！司機沒有考核就從事載客行為，車子是合法嗎？有無保險？非常明顯的不法，假冒科技之名，實則譲人民處於潛藏危險之際，政府還不斷然處置，有違人民信賴！,,,,"It has purchased our money in Taiwan, but do not pay taxes, the government's position there? Are also encourage people to do so? Illegal to catch, that is correct! The driver did not assess engaged in passenger behavior, the car is legal? Whether the insurance? Very obviously illegal, the name of fake science and technology, but in reality the people of Undertaking is in danger lurking on the occasion, the government is not categorically disposal, contrary to the people's trust!"
1437233045002,Sat Jul 18 11:24:05 EDT 2015,42,331,1,0,-1,我覺得營業車（計程車）就是為了營業而經政府的相關單位認證使能行為。然而，自用車乃知其名即行之；它無使用執照且威脅到公共安全。但台灣政府卻拿它沒辦法，真想說....,,,,"I think commercial vehicles (taxis) is to open by the government and relevant units to enable authentication behavior.

1437285376760,Sun Jul 19 01:56:16 EDT 2015,45,371,1,0,-1,我覺得，可以類似共乘但收費的概念,,,,"I think, but the concept can be similar carpool charges"
1437441251342,Mon Jul 20 21:14:11 EDT 2015,47,460,1,0,-1,我覺得UberX只是個披羊皮的狼 / 因為感覺表面是為了大眾 / 背地裡卻是以不合法掩飾鑽法律漏洞的商機/,,,,I think UberX just a wolf in sheep's clothing Phi / surface because the feeling is for the public / privately he is not lawful to hide legal loophole opportunities /

1437476163865,Tue Jul 21 06:56:03 EDT 2015,56,503,1,0,-1,我認為，UBER對營業地的政府與社會，都應該要有財務上的貢獻。,,,,"I think, UBER of government and society of business, should have contributed financially."
1437476182616,Tue Jul 21 06:56:22 EDT 2015,57,503,1,0,-1,我認為運輸業者應該負起保障乘客安全的責任，而政府不應為保護現在的既得利益者，設置不公平的管制規則。,,,,"I think that transport should take the responsibility to protect the safety of passengers, and the government should not now to protect vested interests, setting unfair regulatory rules."
1437476234504,Tue Jul 21 06:57:14 EDT 2015,58,503,1,0,-1,我覺得UBER的車輛素質普遍比一般的計程車還要好。,,,,I think the quality of the vehicle UBER generally better than the average taxi.

1437548539376,Wed Jul 22 03:02:19 EDT 2015,70,528,1,0,-1,Uber在一般計費上較計程車便宜，平均都能省下一個便當的錢。,,,,"Uber taxi cheaper than in the general accounting, on average can save a lunch money."
1437581019078,Wed Jul 22 12:03:39 EDT 2015,73,600,1,0,-1,我覺得應該比照計程車需有營業登記證執照，並且需提供駕駛完整資訊與車內。,,,,"I think we should, mutatis mutandis, the need for a taxi business registration certificate, license, and must provide complete information about the driver and the car."
1437581775896,Wed Jul 22 12:16:15 EDT 2015,74,608,1,0,-1,我覺得ubuerx 沒有像計程車那樣的完整規範搭乘不明人士的自用車是ㄧ件非常可怕的事情 覺得非常沒有保障,,,,I did not feel like a complete specification ubuerx as taxi ride from unknown persons ㄧ car is a very terrible thing feel very insecure

1437581859241,Wed Jul 22 12:17:39 EDT 2015,76,601,1,0,-1,我覺得台灣治安算是很安定，但因為自用車載客或許會隱藏著一些危機！比如乘客如何判斷此車是否為贓車AB車，容易被有心人當作犯案方式，汽車駕駛身心有否通過基本的測驗與健檢，從何依據?對於駕駛的安全考量來說，會不會更容易遇到隨車搶劫的歹徒呢？諸多因素都需要通過嚴密的法案條例去賦予駕駛人跟乘客的保障。只有完善的規劃才有推動UberX正式上路的動力！,,,,"I think Taiwan's security is considered a very stable, but because the passenger car for personal use might hide some of the crisis!

1437584187792,Wed Jul 22 12:56:27 EDT 2015,79,639,1,0,-1,我覺得 Uber 的「費率加成」的邏輯很瞎，並不是真正依照乘車者與服務者雙方的真實使用情況來計算，只是單純的依照時間來區分，導致有時候 UberBlack 會比 UberX 要便宜的奇怪情況出現。,,,,"I think the logic Uber's ""bonus rates"" very blind, not really calculated in accordance with the actual usage of riders and service providers of both parties, but simply in accordance with the time to differentiate, leading to sometimes be cheaper than UberX UberBlack the strange situation."

1437585758564,Wed Jul 22 13:22:38 EDT 2015,82,655,1,0,-1,我覺得不會，因為傳統的計程車都要加入什麼什麼車隊才有辦法生存，這也不是政府規定的，而是由民間制訂出來的，所以我覺得傳統計程車會找到自己的出路，不用為他們擔心，而且UberX顛覆了這項不成文的規定，覺得很棒！但如果政府能夠制定一些政策作為把關，讓這家公司合法，這樣真的可以改善很多交通上的問題。,,,,"I do not think so, because the traditional taxi must be added to what the team only way to survive, this is not required by the Government, but worked out by the private sector, so I think that the traditional taxi will find your way out, do not worry about them and UberX subvert the provisions of this unwritten rule, feel great!

1437616868216,Wed Jul 22 22:01:08 EDT 2015,86,449,1,0,-1,我覺得Uberx人車派遣，目前是不合法、不公平的嚴重侵犯 職業計程車司機的就業生存權。,,,,"I think Uberx vehicles dispatch, at present it is illegal, unjust occupation of a serious violation of the right to life employment taxi drivers."
1437622488687,Wed Jul 22 23:34:48 EDT 2015,88,528,1,0,-1,搭乘計程車有任何問題無從解決，但Uber可以透過應用程式客訴。,,,,"Taxi unable to solve any problems, but you can tell Uber app off."
1437625899912,Thu Jul 23 00:31:39 EDT 2015,91,528,1,0,-1,我覺得台灣放行Uber營運可以讓民眾多一個便捷的交通方式，且Uber有保障乘客許多權益機制。,,,,"I think Taiwan release Uber working people can make more than a convenient mode of transportation, and Uber has many mechanisms to protect the interests of passengers."
1437629783110,Thu Jul 23 01:36:23 EDT 2015,93,886,1,0,-1,我覺得我們真的看太近了，最近聽科技業說，UBER是跟GOOGLE無人車有關。所以GOOLE才不管有無營業執照這件事（但非常注重顧客評比），政府現在所討論的事，過了幾年，GOOLE就可能將UBER改成無人駕駛之計程車，所以應該現在要開始往後面2步思考，無人車載客如何管理的問題、無人車是否可以取代大眾運輸系統，現代大眾系統是否還有興建必要性，以後計程車司機的就業怎麼辦。,,,,"I think we really look too close, the technology industry recently heard to say, UBER is related with GOOGLE unmanned vehicles. So GOOLE do not care whether the business license it (but very focused on customer competitions), what the government is now in question, after a few years, it may be UBER GOOLE into the unmanned taxi, so it should now go back to the beginning of 2 step think, how no one onboard passenger management problem, no one can replace the car if the public transport system, whether public system as well as the construction of a modern necessity, after how taxi drivers do the job."

1438154954727,Wed Jul 29 03:29:14 EDT 2015,127,1960,1,0,-1,我覺得加入UBER需無肇事記錄及良民證才可以加入司機，這一點光是一般計程車或是個人計程車，警政署也未必可以每一台都掌握住動向或情況，最多就是路邊臨檢看看有無酒駕而已,,,,"I feel the need to join UBER no accident record and good citizenship certificate before they can join the drivers, which is usually just a personal taxi or taxi, the NPA may not be able to live each have mastered trends or circumstances, is up to the roadside to see rummage just to see whether drunk driving"

1443414832365,Mon Sep 28 00:33:52 EDT 2015,175,2436,1,0,-1,Uber在台灣屬於新興服務業，目前在法令不明的情況下，業者及司機均遊走在法律邊緣或走法律漏洞的灰暗地帶; 主管機關可謂睜一隻眼，閉一隻眼。但長此以往，總不是辦法吧!政府機關應盡速制定法令，納入公權力管理及監督範疇，或依法行政及依法取締，如此業者.司機及乘客三方才有法律保障可言。,,,,"Uber belongs to the emerging service industries in Taiwan, currently under the Act are unclear, operators and drivers are lawyer your way around or go gray zone of legal loopholes; authorities described as an eye, close one eye. But the long run, it is not always the way! Government agencies enact laws and regulations as soon as possible, into the public power management and supervision areas, or administration according to law and banned by law, so the industry. Drivers and passengers of the three parties have a legal protection at all."

Uber course, would like to fight for the legalization of the government, but also to protect and fight for the rights of drivers. I was drunk passenger car vomit filth, to clean the body odor of business days; followed by a traffic accident, no emergency dial phone, no one concerned about the aftermath, afterwards only told to use their own insurance company to try again. I have more losses, Uber can be described as indifferent!"
