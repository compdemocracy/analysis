Deliberation is a vital ingredient of a robust democracy. In ancient Athens, the oft cited birthplace of
democracy, citizens directly participated in decision making processes [Cartledge, 2016] (until, after plague
and military defeat, they were forced into oligarchy by Sparta). As statespopulations grew in power,
population and territory, representative systems of government supplanted direct decision making by citizens,
in those states which embraced some form of democracy, such as Rome [CITE]. With the Enlightenment came
thinkers like Rousseau who argued for a return to more direct forms of democracy which better reflect the
general will of the people. While these ideas helped inspire the revolutionary movements of the 18th and 19th
centuries, those movements ultimately led towards representative governments, save for a brief period with the
besieged Paris Commune. Nonetheless, since the advent of the printing press and institutionalized journalism,
public opinion has indirectly influenced formal decision making structures  of representation,. Today, opinion
through polling and focus groups serve as levers through which these institutions help shape the public’s
understanding of public opinion, giving citizens voice indirect influence in governanceindirect by academic
researchers. As technology has improved, so has the ability for the people to weigh in on issues in real-time
of their own accord. This has been observed even in platforms not explicitly built for deliberation or
democratic engagement, such as Podemos’ use of Reddit [Blitzer, 2014]. However, the coherent aggregation that
results from intentional meaning making and platform design has lagged, and left emergent, qualitative
dimensions undervalued as an input to policy-making processes.
